<p>Once the user submits their registration, the system confirms their account and they are ready to start booking their train tickets with ease. Overall, the Train Registration System&apos;s field validation feature provides a convenient and reliable registration process that ensures a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>The Train Registration System ensures that all required fields are properly filled out before allowing users to create an account. This helps to prevent incomplete or inaccurate information from being submitted.</p>
<p>To create an account, the user must provide a valid 11-digit Egyptian phone number starting with 010, 011, 012, or 015 that conforms to the designated pattern. Additionally, the user must provide a valid email address that conforms to the standard format of a valid email.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the system verifies that the provided information has not been used by another user. This ensures that each user has a unique account and minimizes the risk of fraudulent or duplicate accounts.</p>
<p>If all the required fields have been filled out correctly and comply with the specified patterns, the account will be created successfully. This streamlined registration process helps to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience for users, ensuring that they can quickly and easily create an account and start booking their train tickets.</p>

<p>When a user logs in to the application, they are presented with the initial form that serves as the gateway to the rest of the features. The interface includes a functional side bar menu, which enhances the user experience and provides an intuitive and interactive experience within the desktop application.</p>
<p>The home page is the primary page displayed to users upon login. It presents information about the added trips and provides the option to book a ticket through the &apos;book now&apos; button. Clicking on the &apos;book now&apos; button will direct users to the train ticket booking page, which displays available tickets. Users can then select a ticket and choose to either book it by clicking the &apos;save&apos; button or reset all marked seats by clicking the &apos;cancel&apos; button.</p>
<p>To ensure that tickets are not double-booked, the system prohibits the booking of a ticket that has already been booked, either by the user or by another individual. This ensures that users have a seamless and hassle-free experience when booking their tickets.</p>
<p>The account page displays all information related to the user&apos;s account, including their personal information and booked tickets. The user has the option to change their password, but must first correctly enter their current password before making any changes.

<p>The administrator&apos;s dashboard has four tabs, each serving a unique purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first tab, &quot;Home,&quot; allows the administrator to add new trips to the system. To ensure that no fields are left empty, the system prompts the administrator to fill out all required fields before adding the trip.</p>
<p>The second tab, &quot;Tickets,&quot; displays a comprehensive list of all current trips along with the number of tickets that have been booked on each trip. This feature provides the administrator with an at-a-glance view of ticket availability, making it easier to manage and allocate resources.</p>
<p>The third tab, &quot;Account,&quot; allows the administrator to change their password. However, the system mandates that the administrator must follow specific rules while doing so. For example, they must enter their current password correctly before proceeding to enter a new password. Additionally, the new password must match the confirmation password in order to complete the process successfully.</p>
<p>The fourth tab, &quot;Search,&quot; is a powerful and interactive feature that helps the administrator find information quickly and easily. This feature includes a suggestion mechanism that predicts what the administrator is searching for as they type in the search field. The administrator can use this tab to search for a user by any of their information, such as their name, email, or phone number. If the user has booked a ticket, the system will display the relevant data. Additionally, the search feature allows the administrator to search for trips by name and also provides the option to delete trips.&nbsp;</p>
